            <h2 class="header">My Personal Interests</h2>
            <p class="paragraph" id="p1">
                I'm a sophomore here at UVU studying Computer Science.  I chose this major because I wanted a wide variety of exposure to various topics in this field.  I  have yet to decide what I'd like to do for a career, but I currently work at DOMO, Inc. as a Quality Assurance Engineer.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" id="p2">
                I am currently a father of one little girl and father of two fur babies -- a dog and a cat.  My wife, daughter, animals, and I love hanging out with one another when I'm not working or at school.  I am also working on various home renovation and honey-do-list projects on the weekends.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" id="p3">
                I'm a geek at heart -- I like anything one would expect a geek or nerd to like.  I love reading comic books, playing Dungeons & Dragons, chess, videogames, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, etc.  I also like some non-geekish things too like football, building things, outdoors, etc.
